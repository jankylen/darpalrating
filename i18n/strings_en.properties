ADRMIIntroduce=DP Composite Index (DPC) is a comprehensive cryptocurrency market index developed by DPRating.Index constituents are divided into 6 categories: Currency and Payment, Operating System, Trading and Transaction, Real World Gateway, Technical Solution, Others. The top five tokens by market cap within each category are selected as index constituents. Tokens within each category are weighted by market cap. The weighting between categories is determined by the square root of the total market cap. The dual layer weighting approach assures large cap constituents do not skew the overall index value while preventing the exclusion of small cap categories. This enables DPC index to provide a wholistic representation of crypto asset market. DPC white paper is available <a href="http://darpalrating-northeast-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/index/DPC_Methodology_en.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
